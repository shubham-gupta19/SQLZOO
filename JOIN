SELECT player, teamid, stadium, mdate
FROM game 
JOIN goal ON id=matchid AND teamid = 'GER'

SELECT teamname, count(player)
FROM eteam 
JOIN goal ON id=teamid
GROUP BY 1

10. Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.

SELECT distinct stadium, count(player)
FROM game 
JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
GROUP BY 1

11. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.

SELECT matchid,mdate, count(player) as Goals
FROM game 
JOIN goal ON matchid = id

SELECT matchid,mdate, count(player) as Goals
FROM game 
JOIN goal ON matchid = id
WHERE teamid = 'GER'
GROUP BY 1,2
HAVING count(player) > 0

13. List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.

SELECT mdate, team1, sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1, team2, sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
FROM game 
LEFT JOIN goal ON id = matchid
GROUP BY 1,2,4
ORDER BY mdate, id

JOIN Quiz

3. Select the code which shows players, their team and the amount of goals they scored against Greece(GRE).

SELECT player, teamid, COUNT(*)
FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
WHERE (team1 = "GRE" OR team2 = "GRE")
AND teamid != 'GRE'
GROUP BY player, teamid

SELECT DISTINCT teamid, mdate
FROM goal JOIN game on (matchid=id)
WHERE mdate = '9 June 2012'

DEN	9 June 2012
GER	9 June 2012
